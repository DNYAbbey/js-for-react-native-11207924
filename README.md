## Task Descriptions

### Task 1
In this task a JavaScript function called 'processArray' that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter is created. The function's purpose is to
- squares all even values 
- triples all odd numbers in the array 

### Task 2
Another JavaScript function, formatArrayStrings  is created in which it takes two arrays as parameters; 
- an array of strings 
- array returned from the processArray. 

Considering both arrays are of the same length, the word in the string array is modified. 
- The string is capitalized if the corresponding number is even.
- The string is converted to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3
Lastly a new file, userinfo.js is created to contain a function that creates a user profile based on an array of names passed into the function and the array of modified strings from the formatArrayStrings function created in task 2. the UserProfile function is to return an array of objects  each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id that is auto-incremented starting from 1.
